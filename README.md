##My Plan

1. Make Wireframe
2. Establish skeleton of html and css elements
3. Create terms of service checkbox and validatate it
4. create button that shows hidden content and validadte it
5. create drop down box with 3 different options
6. create input to change animal name
7. Remove console.log statements
8. PR dev to main branch





## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

1. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
1. Validate each line of code before moving forward
1. Keep it Simple Simon (KISS)

## Making a plan

1. Make a drawing of your app. **Simple "wireframes"**
1. Once you have a drawing, **name the HTML elements** you'll need to realize your vision**
1. For each HTML element ask: **Why do I need this?**
    - Does this element need **static content**, or is the content **dynamic state**?
    - If **state** where is the source of truth?
1. **Find all the 'events'** (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
1. Once we know the _why_ of elements, state, and events -- think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
1. Think about how to **validate each of your features** according to a Definition of Done
1. Consider what features **_depend_ on what other features**. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.
