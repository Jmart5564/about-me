                Hello Everyone, Let me introduce myself. 
                My name is Bilbo Baggins the hobbit and today is my eleventy-first birthday!
                All I really wanted was to live a quiet peaceful life in my 
                hobbit home, tend to my garden and smoke longbottom leaf(The finest in all the Shire).
                One day, a band of Dwarves showed up at my door(a nasty ol' mess they made) and before
                I knew it, I was leaving the Shire on a grand adventure. After a year of almost being 
                eaten by trolls, meeting elves, being chased by goblins, riding barrels 
                down a river and eventually breaking into a dragons lair to steal back
                a mountain of gold, I find myself back at the shire. My most prized
                possession from that adventure would have to be the mysterious ring 
                I won by out-riddling a quite peculiar creature named gollum. Oh how 
                much I love my ring....my precious....                              
            </p>

                    <input id="terms-checkbox" type="checkbox">
                    I swear on the precious that I will never accept 
                    random quests from Wizards ever again.
